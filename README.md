### What I learned

I struggled trying to center everything because I'm new to HTML and CSS but everything worked out thanks to 
```css 
flex
```
At first all the elements were side-by-side even I was centering everything. It got me so frustrated lol. I used 
```css 
flex-direction: column
``` 
and it worked out well. Centering the component itself was a struggle for me as well. At first the qr-code is at the top of the page and I kept on putting center, all center styles I know but in the end all I need was to give it a padding. This front end mentor challenge is super beginner friendly. But a little bit of working CSS and HTML really helps.
